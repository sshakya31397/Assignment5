This a read me file for assignment 5 on Quicksort Algorithm

there are 2 python files. Quicksort.py contains code for an implementation for quicksort and empirical.py is the testing of both algorithms.

My finding is that, on random inputs, both perform similarly, but randomized Quicksort has the advantage of avoiding the worst-case time complexities in edge cases.
